# Train_Timetable

Because I alwalys need to search train timetable every week and the website is not user-friendly.

Therefore, I decide to program a web scraping code to get the information from Taiwan Railway website. 

Just like a small exam to test my scaping data skill.

The project result is not perfect now, so I will keep uploading and revising.
